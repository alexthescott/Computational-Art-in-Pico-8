A screensaver for Pico-8, inspired by the menu backgrounds found on consoles of the early 2010s. An exploration of plasma, and pseudo noise over ten palettes, each with two offset values applied. 
I encourage you to read the source code, and change some variables around to pull back the curtain! Written and debugged in Pico-8.
